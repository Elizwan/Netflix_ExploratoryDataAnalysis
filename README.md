# Netflix_ExploratoryDataAnalysis
 I want to Perform exploratory data analysis on the **' netflix_data.csv'** data to understand more about movies from the 1990s decade.
 
Questions to be answered are-:

1. **What was the most frequent movie duration in the 1990s? Save an approximate answer as an integer called duration (use 1990 as the decade's start year).**

2. **Count the number of short action movies released in the 1990s and save this integer as short_movie_count.**
